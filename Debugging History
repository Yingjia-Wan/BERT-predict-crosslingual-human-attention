The main body of the project codes comes from the Github project: https://github.com/felixhultin/cross_lingual_relative_importance.
However, some modifications are made in order to get the script running:

1. modified analysis/create_plots.py: def process_tokens
line34
original:
doc = Doc(nlp.vocab, words=tokens)
modified:
doc = spacy.tokens.doc.Doc(nlp.vocab, words=tokens)
